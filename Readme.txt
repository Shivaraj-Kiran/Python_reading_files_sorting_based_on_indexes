This is the project which will help many folks who want to:
1) read .txt, .sf, .doc or any type of non-deliminated files.
2) you can specify inputs required inside the input.csv.
3) here the project consist of two sections one is input and another is output,
base on the requirement you can change the parameters inside the input section and
get the output results as it is expected to.

Cons:
This project will help many guys who are ETL testers and they require to the testing on daily table.
Just like This code reads data from flat file and then converts chunks based on indexes and legth given in the input section.
so that we can get pure DF of extracted_file then we can use the sql-coonector which is again different for different-different tools,
to connect to python and get results into Dataframe and then finally we can compare the extrected data from file to target data from 
sql DB easily.

This will cover data validation from source to stage and stage to base too.
